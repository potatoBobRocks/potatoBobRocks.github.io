We have a particular quality which we would like- order amid the chaos of the modern world. We have a proposed solution that will work very well if funded and need the funds to support lobbyists which will be promoting our group. We also need to raise public awareness with the issue, and we need funding for our advertising. Our group is better than all of the others because of its dedication and vision for the company. ❞ </blockquote>

By actively challenging and dismantling systemic racism, anti-racism works towards creating a more just and inclusive society where opportunities are not limited by one's race or ethnicity.
